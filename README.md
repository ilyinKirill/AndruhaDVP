Are you suffering from a tiring grind? 
The game server didn't design "assist" action? 
You want to relax and watch YouTube, but you find a good party?

No longer need to constantly focus on the game to up lvl, this bot will do it for you.
This bot will make your routine grinding in Lineage 2 (prefer C1) easier and you just need to use hotkeys

HotKeys:

- F1,F2,F3,F5 - Used the corresponding hotkeys on the second skill panel
- F4 - Pickup loot until F4 pressed. 
- F9 - Quick assist and return cursor on previous position
- F11 - Start bot (focuses your on a first party member and enable assist (double right-click) every 1 sec ). If cursor was moved manually - bot stops. 
- F12 - Stop bot (double right-clicking is disabled)
- Up - Previous party member (focuses your cursor on top party member)
- Down - Next party member (focuses your cursor on bottom party member)
- Numpad0 - Disable multiple shout
- Numpad1 - Enable multiple shout
- Numpad2 - Enable single shout
- Numpad5 - Open window for shout message input
- M - open map on second panel 0 hotkey
