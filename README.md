Are you suffering from a tiring grind? 
The game server didn't deign to add "assist" action? 
You want to relax and watch YouTube, but you find a good party?

No longer need to constantly focus on the game to improve a couple of lvl, this bot will do it for you.
This is a bot that will make it easier your routine grinding in Lineage 2 (prefer C1) and you just need to use hotkeys

HotKeys:

- F1 - Quick assist and return cursor on previous position
- F11 - Start bot (focuses your on a first party member and enable assist (double right-click) every 1 sec ). If cursor was moved manually - bot stops. 
- F12 - Stop bot (double right-clicking is disabled)
- Up - Previous party member (focuses your cursor on top party member)
- Down - Next party member (focuses your cursor on bottom party member)
